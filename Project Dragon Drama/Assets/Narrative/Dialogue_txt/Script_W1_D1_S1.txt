	Using the substitution method, we can substitute c for x to determine the limit of the function.
HomeroomTeacher:
	This will be faster than the factoring method we covered earlier this week, but can only be used if-
Sam:
	Psst
HomeroomTeacher:
	-along with the example on the board-
Sam:
	Psst, Bailey. Hey.
Bailey:
	<What?>
Sam:
	Did you do the homework?
Bailey:
	Yes. Did you?
Sam:
	I was hungry.
Bailey:
	That’s… not an excuse…
HomeroomTeacher:
	-we can derive that the limit is-
Sam:
	I’m getting it done now.
Bailey:
	And you're telling me because?
Sam:
	I’m too hungry to finish it…
Bailey:
	. . . . . .
Sam:
	What are we getting for lunch today?
HomeroomTeacher:

		Okay nerd.
	Sam:
 		I’ll meet you in the cafeteria then.
	Sam:

	HomeroomTeacher:
		Yes, Sam. Just try to be back before the end of class this time…
	Sam:
		Of course (not).

	Bailey:		Hopefully they have those pizza squares again
	Sam:
		You actually like those?
	Bailey:
		They’re better than the enchiladas.
	Sam:
		Definitely not. The pizza is spicier than the enchiladas.
	Bailey:
		Pepperoni is supposed to be spicy?
	Sam:
		I was talking about the cheese!
	HomeroomTeacher:
		Excuse me girls! Would you like to join the rest of the class?
	Bailey:
		Sorry Mr. HomeroomTeacher.
	Sam:
		Yeah, sorry Mr. HT.
	HomeroomTeacher:
		I expect better from you Bailey.
	Sam:
		What about me!
	HomeroomTeacher:
		This is just about exactly what I expect from you, Sam.
	Sam:
		<Eyeroll> . . . . . .
	HomeroomTeacher:
		I hope everyone else was following along because I will not be going back over this.
	Sam:
		I’ll meet you in the cafeteria at lunch…
