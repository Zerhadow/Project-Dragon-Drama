HomeroomTeacher:
	Pencils down everyone. Pass your tests up to the front.
Interrupt:
	BELL RINGS
HomeroomTeacher:
	Turn in your tests before leaving for lunch!
Bailey:
	So how do you think you did on the test, Sam?
Sam:
	Pfft. That wasn’t that tough. I don’t get why they force us to spend so much time studying for these.
Bailey:
	Probably so that it “isn’t that tough” when you have to do it…
Sam:
	Yeah yeah. Well I’m going to go grab some lunch. You?
Bailey:
	I’m going to go explore for a bit. I’ll meet you back here before next class.
