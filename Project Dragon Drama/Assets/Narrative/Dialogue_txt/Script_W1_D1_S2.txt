	Nataly, JASSICA, AND PERSIA WALK OUT OF THE CAFETERIA AND BUMP INTO BAILEY
Nataly:
	Ugh. Watch where you’re going, whelp.
Bailey:
	You walked into me!?!
Persia:
	You should know better than to be where Nataly is walking.
Nataly:
	Leave it, Persia. Bookworm Bailey isn’t worth our time.
Bailey:
	That’s not even a good insult…
Jassica:
	We could just point out your weight. She just didn’t want to call out your weight.
Nataly:
	Right, what Jass said.
Persia:
	Yeah! What Nat said.
Bailey:
	. . . . . .
Nataly:
	Come on, we have better things to do than waste time on her.
Bailey:
	Right, because your time matters sooo much.
Nataly:
	Why yes. It does.
Jassica:
	Do you really want us to stay here and keep mocking you?
