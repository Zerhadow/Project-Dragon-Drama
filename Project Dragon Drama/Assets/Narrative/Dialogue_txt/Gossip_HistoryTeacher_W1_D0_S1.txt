		Bailey:
			What do you know about the upcoming dance?
		HistoryTeacher:
			Oh, I guess as much as any other teacher. A lot of students really look forward to it each year.
		Bailey:
			Do you know anything about the votes for Homecoming King and Queen?
		HistoryTeacher:
			Not much. But I am surprised you’re interested.
		HistoryTeacher:
			I never took you to be one who was interested in trying to win those kinds of competitions.
		Bailey:
			Oh. I wasn't going to run, I was just curious…
		HistoryTeacher:
			Well either way, good luck!
BDN_HistoryTeacher_W1_BO2
		Bailey:
			I was wondering if there were any problems with holding a vote too early.
		HistoryTeacher:
			Taking an interest in politics are we?
		Bailey:
			<plottingly> In a way…
		HistoryTeacher:
			Well it depends on the election, but namely the biggest problem with allowing votes too early is the possibility that something changes with the candidates before the deadline.
		HistoryTeacher:
			For instance, if one candidate gets a large number of early votes, but then becomes ineligible to run for some reason, then all those votes will suddenly go to waste.
		Bailey:
			What if people just stopped liking the person they voted for?
		HistoryTeacher:
			Absolutely! Voters’ minds can sway dramatically over time and lead to a lot of regret.
		HistoryTeacher:
			We actually saw that play out here at HighschoolName a few years ago with the vote for Homecoming King. One student won the vote but then got kicked off the Sportsball team and caused a lot of voter’s regret.
		Bailey:
			Thank you for the advice, HistoryTeacher!
		HistoryTeacher:
			Any time! I’m always happy to help curious students.
