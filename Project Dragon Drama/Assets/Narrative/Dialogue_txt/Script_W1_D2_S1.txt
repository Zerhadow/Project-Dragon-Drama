	Hey Bai!
Sam:
	You ready to break the shackles of highschool oppression?
Bailey:
	I… guess?
Sam:
	Killer! Let’s get started!
Bailey:
	After class.
Sam:
	Right, after class. Of course.
Bailey:
	Of course.

HomeroomTeacher:
	-anyhomeworkbeforethetesttomorrow!
HomeroomTeacher:
	Class dismissed.
Sam:
	Finally!!! I thought class would never end.
Sam:
	But I stayed all class so now you have to go along with my plan for not leaving.
Bailey:
	If this scheme gets you to stop skipping, then sure.
Sam:
	No promises.
Bailey:
	. . . . . .
Sam:
	We’ve got all of lunch and free period to try and change the [Planning Committee]’s mind.
Sam:
	I’ll reach out to my “contacts” while you see if you can follow up on that lead I found.
Bailey:
	You have “contacts” now?
Sam:
	I have my ways.
Sam:
	And you have a PlanningCommittee to trick.
Bailey:
	I’d prefer if we called it “persuade” instead.
Sam:
	Either way, you need to “persuade” them by tomorrow or they’ll start taking votes on Monday.
Bailey:
	Right. Let’s get started then.
