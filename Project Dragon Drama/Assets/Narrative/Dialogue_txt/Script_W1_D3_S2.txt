	Hey Bai!
Sam:
	Were you able to “persuade” the [PlanningCommittee] to move back the vote?

	Bailey:
		They’re on board with moving it back.
	Bailey:
		Though they will only wait until the week of the dance itself.
	Sam:
		Perfect! That gives us three whole weeks to execute our plan.
	Sam:
		We’ll start by breaking up Nataly’s little gang and then go for her directly!
	Bailey:
		Doesn’t this seem a little mean?
	Sam:
		Well they’re a lot mean so they deserve it.
	Bailey:
		I guess…
	Bailey:
		So how do we go about breaking up her group?
	Sam:
		We’ll need to find a weakness we can exploit to make them turn on each other.
	Sam:
		Let’s do some recon this weekend and we can pick our first victim for next week.
	Bailey:
		Do we have to call them a victim?
	Sam:
		Our first target?
	Bailey:
		. . . . . .
	Sam:
		Fine. Our first girl we are going to liberate from Nataly’s presence.
	Bailey:
		I guess that doesn’t sound so bad.
	Sam:
		You can admit this is going to be fun.
	Bailey:
		Okay… Maybe a little…
	Bailey:
		Let’s definitely make time this weekend to iron out our plan.
	Sam:
		Oh heck yeah! You are so on board!
	Interrupt
		BELL RINGS
	Sam:
		Give me a call after school so we can meet up!

	Bailey:
		No. They don’t want to move it at all.
	Sam:
		Hmm. Well that’s going to make things really difficult.
	Sam:
		We can probably still do something before the dance to mess with her…
	Bailey:
		Sam. Is this really even worth it?
	Sam:
		I mean, Nataly definitely deserves it…
	Sam:
		But I guess you’re right…
	Sam:
		There’s not much we can do before people start voting on Monday…
	Bailey:
		It was fun to come up with the plot at least.
	Sam:
		Yeah. It was.
	Bailey:
		On the bright side, now you’ll have time to finish your homework!
	Sam:
		Yeah… But…
	Bailey:
		What?
	Sam:
		SETFLAG(TRUE): SecretEnding_TooHungryToStart
		I’m too hungry to finish it…
