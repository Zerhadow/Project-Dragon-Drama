Sam:
	So were you able to convince the Dance Committee to move back the vote?
FLAG BRANCH: INTRODUCTION QUEST COMPLETE
	True:
		Bailey:
			They’re on board with moving it back.
		Bailey:
			Though they will only wait until the week of the dance itself.
		Sam:
			Perfect! That gives us three weeks total to execute our plan.
		Sam:
			We’ll start by breaking up Nataly’s little gang and then go for her directly!
		Bailey:
			Doesn’t this seem a little mean?
		Sam:
			Well they’re a lot of mean so they deserve it.
		Bailey:
			I guess…
		Bailey:
			So how do we go about breaking up her group?
		Sam:
			We’ll need to find a weakness we can exploit to make them turn on each other.
		Sam:
			Let’s do some recon this weekend and we can pick our first victim for next week.
		Bailey:
			Do we have to call them a victim?
		Sam:
			Our first target?
		Bailey:
			. . . . . .
		Sam:
			Fine, our first girl we are going to liberate from Nataly’s presence.
		Bailey:
			I guess that doesn’t sound so bad.
		Sam:
			<laughing> You can admit you’re going to enjoy this.
		Bailey:
			<laughing> Okay… Maybe a little…
		Bailey:
			Let’s definitely make time this weekend to iron out our plan.
		Sam:
			Oh heck yeah you’re on board!
		Interrupt:
			BELL RINGS
		Sam:
			Give me a call after school so we can meet up!
	False:
		Bailey:
			No. They don’t want to move it at all.
		Sam:
			Hmm. Well that’s going to make things really difficult.
		Sam:
			We can probably still do something before the dance to mess with her…
		Bailey:
			Sam, is this really even worth it?
		Sam:
			I mean, Nataly definitely deserves it…
		Sam:
			But I guess you’re right… There’s not much we can do before people start voting on Monday…
		Bailey:
			It was fun to come up with the plot at least.
		Sam:
			Yeah. I guess it was…
		Bailey:
			On the bright side, now you’ll have time to finish the homework so you can at least turn it in late.
		Sam:
			Yeah… But…
		Bailey:
			What?
		Sam:
			I’m too hungry to finish it…
