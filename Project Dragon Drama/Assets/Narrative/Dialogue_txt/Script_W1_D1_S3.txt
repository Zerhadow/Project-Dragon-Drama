Sam:
	Finally! I thought you’d spend all lunch taking more notes or something.
Bailey:
	Well. Some of us wait for the class to be over before leaving.
Sam:
	And some of us get pizza while it’s still warm.
Bailey:
	<under her breath> But it’s better cold…
Sam:
	Speaking of which, I got some extra slices for you.
Bailey:
	I think I’m just going to have a light sandwich…
Sam:
	What’s up? I thought you liked the school pizzas?
Bailey:
	Yeah. It’s… nothing. Just something Nataly said…
Sam:
	Nataly? Why were you talking with Nataly? We hate Nataly.
Bailey:
	It wasn’t exactly by choice. She just bumped into me.
Sam:
	So you stopped to make some not-so-pleasant small talk?
Bailey:
	No, I mean she literally bumped into me. She walked right into me and then blamed ME for it.
Sam:
	Ugh. That is exactly something that smaug bitch would do.
Sam:
	What did she even say?

		Bailey:
			She called me “Bookworm Bailey.”
		Sam:
			Seriously!? That’s not even a good insult.
		Bailey:
			That’s what I said!
		Sam:
			How are you going to let something like  that get to you?
		Bailey:
			I know. It’s dumb. Jassica and Persia were with her and it just got to me.
		Sam:
			Dude. Nataly wouldn’t be nothing without those two backing her up.
		Bailey:
			That’s a double negative. “wouldn’t be nothing” means she would still be something.
		Sam:
			Yeah, she’d still be a smug bitch.
		Sam:
			<laughing> And only a bookworm would point out a double negative, Bailey.
		Bailey:
			<laughing> That’s still not a good insult.
Bailey:
Give me a slice of the pepperoni.
BDN_Intro_3_BO2
		Bailey:
			Jass and her made a comment about my weight.
		Sam:
			Bailey, you’re not fat.
		Bailey:
			I know…
		Sam:
			No, seriously. You’re practically a twig. If anything you need more pizza, not less.
		Bailey:
			I don’t think anyone has ever made a case for more pizza being the healthy choice.
		Sam:
			Screw the healthy choice.
		Sam:
			And screw Natlie’s little popular girl club. Who even cares what they think?
		Bailey:
			I mean, a lot of the rest of the school.
		{-1 Relationship with School}
		Sam:
			Well we don’t. Here, just take a slice before it starts to get cold.
		Bailey:
			But it’s better co-

			<laughing> It is not better cold!!!
BDN_Intro_3_BO3

			It was dumb. It doesn’t really matter.

		Sam:
			Eyyy, that’s my girl!.
		Sam:
			Still though…
		Sam:
	 I hate that she just gets away with that crap.
		Bailey:
			I know, but she isn’t worth it. 
		Sam:
			Yeah, you’re right… maybe. Here, take a slice before it starts to get cold.

	CROSSFADE THROUGH BLACK
Bailey:
	I don’t think I can eat another slice.
Sam:
	I’ve got it!
Bailey:
	Well okay, you can have the rest.
Sam:
	What?
Sam:
	Oh, no thanks. I was thinking about how we can get back at Nataly and her puppets.
Bailey:
	You really don’t have to keep comforting me. I’d rather just forget about what they said today.
Sam:
	No, not just for today, but for how they are all the time!
Bailey:
	Sam…
Sam:
	Come on! Trust me Bailey. It’ll be great!
Bailey:
	As long as it doesn’t involve anything that will get us in trouble.
Sam:
	No promises!
Sam:
	So, the upcoming homecoming dance…
Bailey:
	I don’t think I like where this is going.
Sam:
	Oh can it. You haven’t even heard the plan yet.
Sam:
	So long story short Nataly is obsessed with winning Homecoming Queen.
Bailey:
	Well yeah. Everyone knows that. 
Sam:
	And it’s pretty much a guarantee since Ken is her boyfriend. The quarterback is always voted for king.
Bailey:
	So?
Sam:
	So we’re going to break them up!
Bailey:
	What!?! Why!?!
Sam:
	Think about it. If Ken and Nataly aren’t together, then Homecoming Queen will be up for grabs!
Sam:
	And who’s going to vote for the quarterback’s ex?
Bailey:
	Ethical concerns aside, how would we even do that?
Sam:
	I have a few ideas… <evil grin>
Sam:
	I’ll work out the details, but I need you to talk to the Student Planning Committee first.
Bailey:
	You’re not wanting me to try and convince them to go along with this, are you?
Sam:
	We just need to confirm they’ll hold the vote separately and that they won’t take any votes until homecoming.
Bailey:
	Assuming I agree to do this, do I have to be the one to talk to the Planning Committee?
Sam:
	Has to be you. I still have to finish last night’s math homework, remember?
Bailey:
	That’s… at least a better excuse…
Sam:
	<laughing> I’ll be back in class after you talk to the dance committee.
Sam:
	Good luck!
Bailey:
	*long sigh* Okay…
