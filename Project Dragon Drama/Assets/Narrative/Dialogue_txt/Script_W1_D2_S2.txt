			Yo! Bailey! 
		Bailey:
			Hey Sam, how’s it going?
		Sam:
			Pretty good. Just trying to avoid studying for the test tomorrow.
		Bailey:
			…
		Sam:
			You still there?
		Bailey:
			Yes.
		Sam:
			By the ways, I was talking with Janitor about some stuff after lunch today and they’ve been at the school for quite a bit.
		Bailey:
			Who’s Janitor?
		Sam:
			They’re the school janitor. They usually hang around outside the cafeteria. Pretty cool guy honestly.
		Bailey:
			Oh, I didn’t think there was anyone on the school staff you liked.
		Sam:
			What are you talking about? There’s tons of people there I like!
		Bailey:
			Like Who?
		Sam:
			You know… the nurse… that one lunch lady that gives extra dessert… the art teacher…
		Bailey:
			So basically anyone that doesn’t give homework?
		Sam:
			Exactly!
		Bailey:
			<laughing> Of course.
		Sam:
			Speaking of homework, I need to get back to finishing the math stuff from today.
		Bailey:
			Wait. Are you actually doing your homework for once?
		Sam:
			Yes…
		Sam:
			Definitely…
		Sam:
			Probably…
		Sam:
			Bye!
		Interrupt:

		Bailey:
			Hahahaha.
