Kyle:
	The dance is free to everyone…
Bailey:
	Um, excuse me?
Kaylee:
	HELLO! ARE YOU HERE TO VOLUNTEER?
Bailey:
	<scared> Uh… actually… I, uh…
Kyle:
	Kaylee, you’re going to keep scaring everyone off if you don’t stop yelling…
Kaylee:
	BUT THIS IS SO EXCITING Kyle!!!
Bailey:
	I just had a quick question actually.
Kaylee:
	IS IT ABOUT THE HOMECOMING DANCE?
Bailey:
	Yes? Um…
Kyle:
	Ignore Kaylee. What’s the question?
Bailey:
	How were you going to do the voting for the dance?
Bailey:
	For King and Queen I mean.
Kaylee:
	PEOPLE WILL VOTE ON WHO THEY WANT AND THE PERSON WITH THE MOST VOTES WINS!
Kyle:
	We’ll let people start voting next week up until the dance.

	2 -> Could You Change That…

		Bailey:
			But don’t people usually vote for the quarterback and his girlfriend?
		Kaylee:
			SO?
		Bailey:
			Well what if they were broken up before the dance?
		Bailey:
			I mean what if they choose to break up? Hypothetically?
		Kyle:
			Why? Is something up with Ken and Nataly?
		Bailey:
			No…
		Bailey:
			Just hypothetically…
		Kaylee:
			THAT WOULD BE SOO AWKWARD! COULD YOU EVEN IMAGINE???
		Kyle:
			I guess it would be weird.
		Kyle:
			But we can’t wait until the night of the dance. There wouldn’t be enough time for people to vote.
		Bailey:
			A lot can change in a month, though. You should at least wait until homecoming week.
		Bailey:
			That way you can remind people about the upcoming vote and still account for if… something… happens.
		Kaylee:
			THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT IDEA!
		Kyle:
			We’d have to set up the voting table for the whole day instead of just during lunch periods, but I think we could manage that.
		{COMPLETE QUEST: TUTORIAL}
		Kaylee:
			ARE YOU SURE YOU DON’T WANT TO VOLUNTEER? YOU’RE REALLY GOOD AT THIS!
		Bailey:
			Oh, um, no thanks.
		Bailey:
			Good luck though! <smiling>
BDN_IntroQuest_1_BO2
		Bailey:
			Do you think you could move back when people are able to vote?
		Kaylee:
			NOPE!
		Kyle:
			We need to give everyone time to vote and the Planning Committee will need time to count all the votes before the dance.
		Bailey:
			Oh, right…
		Kaylee:
			SORRY!
		Head Planner:
			BUT IF YOU HAVE OTHER IDEAS, MAYBE YOU SHOULD VOLUNTEER!!!
		Bailey:
			Oh, uh, no thank you…
END BRANCH
Kaylee:
	OKAY THEN!! WE HOPE YOU ENJOY THE DANCE!!!
Kyle:
	Seriously, you have to stop yelling at everyone…
Kaylee:
	OKAY Kyle!!!
