		Bailey:
			Not so well…
		Bailey:
			They aren’t willing to delay the voting.
		Sam:
			Hm… that makes things more difficult.
		Bailey:
			I guess the plan just isn’t meant to be…
		Sam:
			Nah!! We just have to come up with a plan to convince the Dance Committee!
		Bailey:
			Now we need a plan to start our other plan? Isn’t this getting a little complicated?
		Sam:
			What great quest doesn’t have a few side quests along the way?
		Bailey:
			<laughing> So now we’re on a quest?
		Sam:
			Let’s figure out a plan for the Dance Committee tonight after school.
		Bailey:
			Don’t you still have homework?
		Sam:
			I got all that finished while you were chatting up  the Planning Committee.
		Bailey:
			Oh really?
		Sam:
			<laughing> I finished enough to get a passing grade.
		Sam:
			Besides, I know all of your homework is already done.
		Bailey:
			That’s not the point…
		Interrupt:
			BELL RINGS
		Sam:
			Out of time to talk about homework! Back to class!

		Bailey:
			I still need a little more time.
		Sam:
			Okay. We’ve still got some time before class starts.
		Bailey:
			Enough time for your homework??
		Sam:
			Relax. I’ll get it done.
