		Not so well…
	Bailey:
		They aren’t willing to delay the voting.
	Sam:
		Hm… that makes things more difficult.
	Bailey:
		I guess the plan just isn’t meant to be…
	Sam:
		Nah! We just have to come up with a new plan to convince the [Planning Committee!]
	Bailey:
		Now we need a plan to start our other plan?
	Bailey:
		Isn’t this getting a little complicated?
	Sam:
		What great quest doesn’t have a few side quests along the way?
	Bailey:
		So now we’re on a quest?
	Sam:
		Let’s figure out the plan for the [Planning Committee] tonight after school.
	Bailey:
		Don’t you still have homework?
	Sam:
		I got all that finished while you were chatting up the [Planning Committee].
	Bailey:
		Oh really?
	Sam:
		Enough to at least get a passing grade.
	Sam:
		Besides, I know all of your homework for tonight is already done.
	Bailey:
		That’s not the point…

		Enough time for you to finish your homework?
	Sam:
		Relax. I’ll get it done.
