			HEYYY! BAILEEEY! 
		Bailey:
			Hey Sam. How’s the homework going?
		Sam:
			Eh, I’ll worry about that tomorrow.
		Sam:
			Have you put any thought into how to go about convincing the Dance Committee?
		Bailey:
			Oh, we’re going right into that.
		Bailey:
			What has you so invested in this?
		Sam:
			What do you mean!?!
		Sam:
			We’re literally plotting a social coup to overthrow the hierarchical status quo!
		Sam:
			How are you NOT excited by that?
		Bailey:
			<laughing> Okay, put that way it does sound fun.
		Bailey:
			But I don’t have any ideas yet for the Dance Committee.
		Sam:
			I don’t have anything iron yet either.
		Sam:
			But…
		Sam:
 			I have been going through some old HighschoolName socials and might have something you can use.
		Sam:
			It looks like there was some drama about the couple that won king and queen a few years ago. Back when we were still in middle school.
		Bailey:
			How does old drama from before we were  even at HighschoolName help us?
		Sam:
			We weren’t there, but the teachers were.
		Sam:
			We just have to find one that will tell us what happened.
		Bailey:
			Well, that is a start, I guess.
		Sam:
			There’s probably other ways to get through to the Planning Committee too.
		Sam:
			If all else fails, you can always just talk to people and see where it goes.
		Bailey:
			Do I really have to talk to more people…
		Sam:
			It’ll be good for you! Besides, you’re better at it  than you think.
		Bailey:
			Wait. What are you going to be doing during all this?
		Sam:
			Finishing my homework.
		Bailey:
			It’s meant to be done at ho-
		Sam:
			Oop. Gotta go! Dinner’s ready!
		Interrupt:
			<CLICK>
		Bailey:
			Hello? Sam?
		Bailey:
			Sigh…
