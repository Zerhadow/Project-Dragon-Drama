Have you put any thought into our plan?
BEGIN DNL
ETSDN 5

	BEGIN DNL
ETSDN 7

	BEGIN DNL
ETSDN 8
Sam:

BEGIN DNL
ETSDN 10

	Okay. When you put it like that it does sound fun.
BEGIN DNL
ETSDN 11
Bailey: 
Defeated
	But I don’t have any ideas for the [Planning Committee] yet.
BEGIN DNL

Confident
But…
BEGIN DNL
ETSDN 14
Sam: 
Confident
I have been going through the old [HighschoolName] socials and might have something you can use.
BEGIN DNL
ETSDN 15
Sam: 
Confident
It looks like there was some drama about the couple that won king and queen a few years ago. Back when we were still in middle school.
BEGIN DNL
ETSDN 16
Bailey: 
Interested
Okay. How does old drama from before we were  even at [HighschoolName] help us?
BEGIN DNL
ETSDN 17
Sam: 
Mischievous
	We weren’t there.
BEGIN DNL
ETSDN 18
Sam: 
Confident
But the teachers were.
BEGIN DNL
ETSDN 19
Sam: 
Relaxed
We just have to find one that will tell us what happened.
BEGIN DNL
ETSDN 20
Bailey: 
Neutral
Well, I guess that’s a start at least.
BEGIN DNL
ETSDN 21
Sam: 
Happy
There’s probably other ways to get through to the [Planning Committee] too.
BEGIN DNL
ETSDN 22
Sam: 
Happy
If all else fails, you can always just talk to people and see where it goes.
BEGIN DNL
ETSDN 23
Bailey: 
Defeated
Do I really have to talk to more people…
BEGIN DNL
ETSDN 24
Sam: 
Laughing
It’ll be good for you!
BEGIN DNL
ETSDN 25

Besides, you’re better at it  than you think.
BEGIN DNL
ETSDN 26
