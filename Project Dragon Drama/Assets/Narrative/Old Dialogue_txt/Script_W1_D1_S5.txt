		Sup Bai?
	Bailey:
		Hey Sam.
	Bailey:
		How were your afternoon classes?
	Sam:
		Forget about those!
	Sam:
		Have you put any thought into how to go about convincing the PlanningCommittee?
	Bailey:
		Oh, we’re going right into that.
	Bailey:
		What has you so invested in this?
	Sam:
		What do you mean!?!
	Sam:
		We’re literally plotting a social coup to overthrow the school’s hierarchical status quo!!
	Sam:
		How are you NOT excited by that?
	Bailey:
		Okay. When you put it like that it does sound fun.
	Bailey:
		But I don’t have any ideas for the [Planning Committee] yet.
	Sam:
		I don’t have anything iron yet either.
	Sam:
		But…
	Sam:
 		I have been going through the old HighschoolName socials and might have something you can use.
	Sam:
		It looks like there was some drama about the couple that won king and queen a few years ago. Back when we were still in middle school.
	Bailey:
		Okay. How does old drama from before we were  even at [HighschoolName] help us?
	Sam:
		We weren’t there.
	Sam:
 		But the teachers were.
	Sam:
		We just have to find one that will tell us what happened.
	Bailey:
		Well, I guess that’s a start at least.
	Sam:
		There’s probably other ways to get through to the [Planning Committee] too.
	Sam:
		If all else fails, you can always just talk to people and see where it goes.
	Bailey:
		Do I really have to talk to more people…
	Sam:
		It’ll be good for you!
	Sam:
		Besides, you’re better at it  than you think.
	Bailey:
		Wait. What are you going to be doing during all this?
	Sam:
		Finishing my homework.
	Bailey:
		It’s meant to be done at ho-
