	Bailey:
		What do you know about the [homecoming] dance?
	HistoryTeacher:
		Oh, I guess as much as any other teacher.
	HistoryTeacher:
		A lot of students really look forward to it each year.
	Bailey:
		Do you know anything about the votes for [Homecoming] King and Queen?
	HistoryTeacher:
		Not much. But I am surprised you’re interested.
	HistoryTeacher:
		I never took you to be one who was interested in trying to win those kinds of competitions.
	Bailey:
		Oh. I wasn't going to run! I was just curious!
	HistoryTeacher:
		Well either way, good luck!

	Bailey:
		I was wondering if there were any problems with holding a vote too early.
	HistoryTeacher:
		Taking an interest in politics, are we?
	Bailey:
		In a way…
	HistoryTeacher:
		Well, it depends on the election.
	HistoryTeacher:
		But namely the biggest problem with allowing a vote too early is the possibility that a candidate changes their policy to get more votes over time.
	Bailey:
		What if people just stopped liking the person they voted for?
	HistoryTeacher:
		Absolutely! Voters’ minds can sway dramatically and lead to a good deal of regret or indecision.
	HistoryTeacher:
		We actually saw this very scenario play out here at HighschoolName a few years back with the vote for Homecoming King.
	HistoryTeacher:
		One student won the vote but then got kicked off the Sportsball team and caused a lot of controversy as the quarterback traditionally receives the title.
	Bailey:
		That’s very interesting!
	Bailey:
		Thank you for the advice, HistoryTeacher!
	HistoryTeacher:
		SETFLAG(TRUE): DanceVoteGossipObtained
		Any time! I’m always happy to help curious students.
