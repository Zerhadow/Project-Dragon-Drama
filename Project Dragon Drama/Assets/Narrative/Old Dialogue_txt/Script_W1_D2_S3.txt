		Bailey:
			What are you up to tonight?
		Sam:
			Not much. Just trying to avoid studying for the test tomorrow.
		Bailey:
			…
		Sam:
			You still there Bai?
		Bailey:
			Yeah, I’m here.
		Sam:
			Don’t worry. I’ll be ready for the test ya Nerd.
		Bailey:
			You’re just jealous I get better grades.
		Sam:
			And you’re just jealous I still pass!
		Sam:
			By the ways, I was talking with the janitor after lunch today, and they’ve been around the school for quitea while.
		Bailey:
			Oh? I didn’t think there was anyone on the school staff you liked.
		Sam:
			What are you talking about? There’s tons of people there I like!
		Bailey:
			Like Who?
		Sam:
			You know… the nurse… the art teacher…
		Sam:
			That one lunch lady that gives extra dessert…
		Bailey:
			So basically anyone that doesn’t give homework?
		Sam:
			Exactly!
		Sam:
			Speaking of homework, I need to get back to finishing that math stuff from today.
		Bailey:
			Wait! Are you actually doing your homework for once?
		Sam:
			Yes…
		Sam:
			Definitely…
		Sam:
			Probably…

			Sup Bai?
		Bailey:
			Hey Sam.
		Bailey:
			How were your afternoon classes?
		Sam:
			Forget about those!
		Sam:
			Have you put any thought into how to go about convincing the PlanningCommittee?
		Bailey:
			Oh, we’re going right into that.
		Bailey:
			What has you so invested in this?
		Sam:
			What do you mean!?!
		Sam:
			We’re literally plotting a social coup to overthrow the school’s  hierarchical status quo!!
		Sam:
			How are you NOT excited by that?
		Bailey:
			Okay. When you put it like that it does sound fun.
		Bailey:
			But I don’t have any ideas for the [Planning Committee] yet.
		Sam:
			I don’t have anything iron yet either.
		Sam:
			But…
		Sam:
			I have been going through the old HighschoolName socials and might have something you can use.
		Sam:
			It looks like there was some drama about the couple that won king and queen a few years ago. Back when we were still in middle school.
		Bailey:
			Okay. How does old drama from before we were  even at HighschoolName help us?
		Sam:
			We weren’t there.
		Sam:
			But the teachers were.
		Sam:
			We just have to find one that will tell us what happened.
		Bailey:
			Well, I guess that’s a start at least.
		Sam:
			There’s probably other ways to get through to the [Planning Committee] too.
		Sam:
			If all else fails, you can always just talk to people and see where it goes.
		Bailey:
			Do I really have to talk to more people…
		Sam:
			It’ll be good for you!
		Sam:
			Besides, you’re better at it  than you think.
		Bailey:
			Wait. What are you going to be doing during all this?
		Sam:
			Finishing my homework.
		Bailey:
			It’s meant to be done at ho-
