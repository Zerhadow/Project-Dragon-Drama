	Bailey:
		Um, excuse me?
	HeadPlanner:
		HI BAILEY!
	HeadPlanner:
		DID YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND ABOUT VOLUNTEERING?
	Bailey:
		Oh… um… no…
	Planner2:
		Did you have another question about the homecoming votes?

BDN_IntroQuest_BO2
	HeadPlanner:
		COME JOIN THE DANCE PLANNING COMMITTEE FOR homecoming!
	HeadPlanner:
		FREE ADMISSION TO THE DANCE FOR THOSE ON THE COMMITTEE!
	Planner2:
		The dance is free to everyone…
	Bailey:
		Um, excuse me?
	HeadPlanner:
		HELLO!
	HeadPlanner:
		ARE YOU HERE TO VOLUNTEER?
	Bailey:
		Uh… actually… I, uh…
	Planner2:
		HeadPlanner, you’re going to keep scaring everyone off if you don’t stop yelling…
	HeadPlanner:
		BUT ISN’T THIS SO EXCITING Planner2!?!
	Bailey:
		Uh, excuse me. I just had a quick question actually.
	HeadPlanner:
		IS IT ABOUT THE HOMECOMING DANCE?
	Bailey:
		Yes? Um…
	Planner2:
		Ignore HeadPlanner. What’s the question?
	Bailey:
		Um, how were you going to do the voting for the homecoming dance?
	Bailey:
		For King and Queen I mean.
	HeadPlanner:
		PEOPLE WILL VOTE ON WHO THEY WANT AND THE PERSON WITH THE MOST VOTES WINS!
	Planner2:
		SETFLAG(TRUE): TalkedWithPlanningCommittee

	Bailey:
		Don’t people usually just vote for the quarterback and his girlfriend?
	HeadPlanner:
		YEAH. BUT VOTING IN A LARGELY PREDETERMINED AND ARBITRARILY DECIDED POPULARITY CONTEST IS A FUNDAMENTAL STUDENT RIGHT!!!
	Planner2:
		What HeadPlanner means is that the voting still matters even if we already know who will probably win.
	Bailey:
		But, what if they were broken up before the dance?
	Bailey:
		I mean what if they choose to break up?
	Bailey:
		Hypothetically.
	Bailey:
		Of course.
	Planner2:
		Why? Is something up with Ken and Nataly?
	Bailey:
		No…
	Bailey:
		Just a totally hypothetically… hypothetical…
	HeadPlanner:
		THAT WOULD BE SO AWKWARD!! LIKE COULD YOU EVEN IMAGINE???
	Planner2:
		I guess it would be pretty bad.
	Planner2:
		But we still need to give students time to vote.
	Bailey:
		A lot can change in a month.
	Bailey:
		You should at least wait until homecoming week.
	Bailey:
		That way you can remind people about the dance and the vote at the same time!
	Bailey:
		And still account for if… something… happens.
	HeadPlanner:
		THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT IDEA!
	Planner2:
		We’d have to set up the voting table for the whole day instead of just during lunch periods.
	Planner2:
		But I think we could manage that.
	HeadPlanner:
		ARE YOU SURE YOU DON’T WANT TO VOLUNTEER? YOU’RE REALLY GOOD AT THIS!
	Bailey:
		Oh, um, no thanks.
	Bailey:
		Good luck though!

BDN_IntroQuest_2_BO2
	Bailey:
		Do you think you could… move back… when people are able to vote?
	HeadPlanner:
		NOPE!
	Planner2:
		We need to give everyone time to vote and the [Planning Committee] will need time to count all the votes.
	Bailey:
		Oh, right…
	HeadPlanner:
		SORRY!
	HeadPlanner:
		BUT IF YOU HAVE OTHER IDEAS, MAYBE YOU SHOULD VOLUNTEER!!!
	Bailey:
		Oh, uh, no thank you…
