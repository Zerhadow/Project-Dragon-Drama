Sam:
	Finally!
Sam:
	I thought you’d spend all lunch taking more notes or something.
Bailey:
	Well some of us wait for class to be over before leaving.
Sam:
	And some of us get the pizza while it’s still warm!
Bailey:
	But it’s better cold…
Sam:
	Speaking of which, I got some extra slices for you.
Bailey:
	Oh.
Bailey:
	I think I’m just going to have a light sandwich today…
Sam:
	What’s up?
Sam:
	I thought you liked the school pizzas?
Bailey:
	Yeah. It’s… nothing.
Bailey:
	Just something Nataly said…
Sam:
	Nataly? Why were you talking with Nataly?
Sam:
	We hate Nataly.
Bailey:
	It wasn’t exactly by choice.
Bailey:
	She just bumped into me.
Sam:
	So you stopped to make some not-so-pleasant small talk?
Bailey:
	No, I mean she literally bumped into me.
Bailey:
	She literally walked right into me and then blamed ME for it!
Sam:
	Ugh. That is exactly what that flakey-scaled bitch would do.
Bailey:
	Sam!!!
Sam
	What? Just calling her how she is.
Sam:
	What did she even say?

	Bailey:
		She called me “Bookworm Bailey.”
	Sam:
		Seriously!?
	Sam:
		That’s not even a good insult.
	Bailey:
		That’s what I said!
	Sam:
		How are you going to let a little thing like that get to you?
	Bailey:
		I know. It’s dumb.
	Bailey:
		Jassica and Persia were with her and it just… got to me.
	Sam:
		Dude. Nataly wouldn’t be nothing without those two backing her up.
	Bailey:
		That’s a double negative, Sam.
	Sam:
		What?
	Bailey:
		“wouldn’t be nothing” means she would still be something.
	Sam:
		Yeah. She’d still be a flakey-scaled bitch.
	Sam:
		And only a bookworm would point out a double negative, Bailey.
	Bailey:
		That’s still not a good insult.
	Sam:
		Obviously!
	Bailey:
		Okay, pass me a slice of the pepperoni.

	Bailey:
		Jassica and Nataly were making fun of my weight.
	Sam:
		Bailey. You’re not fat.
	Bailey:
		I know…
	Sam:
		No, seriously. You’re practically a twig.
	Sam:
		If anything you need more pizza, not less.
	Bailey:
		Only you could ever make a case for more pizza being the healthy choice.
	Sam:
		Screw the healthy choice!
	Sam:
		And screw Natlie’s flakey little posse.
	Sam:
		Who even cares what they think?
	Bailey:
		-1 Stat SchoolRelationship
		I mean, most of the rest of the school.
	Sam:
		Well we don’t.
	Sam:
		Here, just take a slice before it starts to get cold.
	Bailey:
		But it’s better co-
	Sam:
		IT IS NOT BETTER COLD!!!

	Bailey:
		+1 Stat SamRelationship
		It was dumb. Doesn’t really matter.
	Sam:
		Eyyy! That’s my girl!.
	Sam:
		Still though…
	Sam:
	 	I hate that she just gets away with that crap.
	Bailey:
		I know. But she isn’t worth it. 
	Sam:
		Yeah, you’re probably right…
	Sam:
		Here, take a slice before it starts to get cold.
	Bailey:
		But it’s better co-

	CROSSFADE THROUGH BLACK
Bailey:
	I don’t think I can eat another slice.
Sam:
	I’ve got it!
Bailey:
	Well okay. You can have the rest.
Sam:
	What?
Sam:
	Oh, that’s not what I meant.
Sam:
	I was thinking how we can get back at Nataly and her puppets.
Bailey:
	You really don’t have to keep comforting me.
Bailey:
	I’d rather just forget about what they said today.
Sam:
	No, not just for today. For how they are all the time!
Bailey:
	Sam…
Sam:
	Come on, trust me Bailey.
Sam:
	It’ll be great!
Bailey:
	As long as it doesn’t involve anything that will get us in trouble.
Sam:
	No promises.
Bailey:
	. . . . . .
Sam:
	So, the upcoming homecoming dance…
Bailey:
	I don’t think I like where this is going…
Sam:
	Oh live a little. You haven’t even heard the plan yet.
Sam:
	So Nataly is obsessed with winning [Homecoming] Queen, right?
Bailey:
	Well yeah, everyone knows that.
Sam:
	And it’s pretty much a guarantee since Ken is her boyfriend.
Bailey:
	Yeah, the [quarterback] always wins king.
Bailey:
	So?
Sam:
	So we’re going to break them up!
Bailey:
	What!?! Why!?!
Sam:
	Think about it.
Sam:
	If Ken and Nataly aren’t together, then [Homecoming] Queen will be up for grabs!
Sam:
	And who’s going to vote for the [quarterback]’s ex?
Bailey:
	Okay. Ethical dilemmas aside, how would we even do that?
Sam:
	I have a few ideas…
Sam:
	I’ll work out the details, but I need you to talk to the Student [Planning Committee] first.
Bailey:
	You’re not wanting me to try and convince them to go along with this, are you?
Sam:
	We just need to confirm they’ll hold the vote separately.
Sam:
	And that they won’t take any votes until [homecoming].
Bailey:
	Assuming I agree to go along with this…
Bailey:
	Do I really have to be the one to talk to the [Planning Committee]?
Sam:
	Yep. Has to be you.
Sam:
	I still have to finish last night’s homework, remember?
Bailey:
	That’s… at least an excuse…
Sam:
	I’ll be back in class after you talk to the [planning committee].
Sam:
	Good luck!
Bailey:
	*Huff* Okay…
