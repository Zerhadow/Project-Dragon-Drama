			Okay nerd.

Yes, Sam. Just try to be back before the end of class this time…

Bailey:
			Hopefully they have those pizza squares again
		Sam:
			You actually like those?
		Bailey:
			They’re better than the enchiladas.
		Sam:
			Definitely not. The pizza is spicier than the enchiladas.
		Bailey:
			Pepperoni is supposed to be spicy?
		Sam:
			I was talking about the cheese!
		HomeroomTeacher:
			Excuse me girls! Would you like to join the rest of the class?
		Bailey:
			Sorry Mr. HomeroomTeacher.
		Sam:
Yeah, sorry Mr. HT.
		HomeroomTeacher:
			I expect better from you Bailey.
		Sam:
			What about me!
		HomeroomTeacher:
			This is just about exactly what I expect from you, Sam.
		Sam:
			<Eyeroll> . . . . . .
		HomeroomTeacher:
I hope everyone else was following along because I will not be going back over this.
		Sam:
			I’ll meet you in the cafeteria at lunch…
