Dragon Drama is a narrative 2.5D rpg that is a parody of mean girls, with the twist that everyone is a dragon!

This was a week-long game jam production that has turned into a portfolio project. We're basically just a bunch of college students having fun. This README will be updated to reflect the project's status as time goes on.
